// So, the locking system needed a bit of a rethink...
// (the taskpool can't run until the queue is full)
// In particular, it didn't consider the existence of oscore_event,
//  which exists for the specific purpose of not-breaking-things...

// The FIFO is a ring.
// There are two indexes (the "reading pointer" and "writing pointer"),
//  both of which represent the last processed index.
// The writing pointer refuses to reach the reading pointer,
//  which would turn a full ring into an empty one,
// and the reading pointer refuses to go *past* the writing pointer,
//  which would turn an empty ring into a full one.
